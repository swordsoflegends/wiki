# Reaper

This highly versatile class can virtually become a manifestation of Death itself, capable of hunting enemies with increased speed and strength while teleporting to other locations to swiftly and stealthily spring traps on their enemies.

## Assassin (DPS)

The Reapers command a range of powerful curses and breed poisonous creatures to deploy in combat. In the darkness, they lie in wait for their enemies, attacking with lightning speed and mercilessly cutting them down with a swing of their scythe.|

## Occultist (Support)

Schooled in the ancient healing techniques recorded by the Liao tribe in the Book of Blessed Healing, Reapers can also become Occultists. By sacrificing their own blood, they can call on the mercy of the goddess NÃ¼wa to support their allies in Swords of Legends Online. They can also boost their teammates with special breeds of insects, allowing them to perform beyond their normal capabilities.

Select a teammate to share the damage they receive and help them survive encounters.
