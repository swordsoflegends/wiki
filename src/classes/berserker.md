# Berserker

The Berserker class possesses the ability to transform into a wolf, which can even function as a mount for another ally. They can also tear through their enemies, inflicting great damage by riding atop of their greatswords.

## Slayer (DPS)

Combining the essence of Shennong with the finest swordsmanship in the empire, the Slayers slice and dice their way through the front lines regardless of cost, using swift and brutal attacks to bring enemies to their knees before they have a chance to react. Certain skills can create phantom warriors who can be ordered to attack enemies in tandem with the Slayer.

## Drunken Master (Tank)

Drunken Masters use a specially brewed medicinal wine to make their movements and attacks even wilder and less predictable, granting them a fortuitous edge in combat through their intoxication. They can harness the force of the wind to block enemy attacks or summon a wolf whose howls stir their allies to frenzied action.
