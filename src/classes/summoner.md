# Summoner

Summoners can conjure various spirits to aid them while they utilize spiritual energy to damage foes or support their allies in combat. Their minds working in union with nature, they can also summon a tiger companion which they can ride on their journeys.

## Nature’s Wrath (Ranged DPS)

Offering themselves as nature’s tools, Summoners use their innate ability to summon spirits to attack their opponents. Their powerful Soulforce allows them to channel their spiritual energies into a gleaming beam of light to smite down their foes. Whether it be the fox-like companion Mingshi, or Golden Feather, a creature that will briefly attract the attention of their enemies, Nature’s Wrath Summoners can adapt to various forms of combat.

## Nuwa’s Blessing (Support)

Channeling the flow of spiritual energy through their prayers of devotion, Nuwa’s Blessing Summoners can cast a range of effects to heal their teammates over time. The healing fairy Moluo can be summoned to further sustain their allies through challenging fights or commanded to use specific skills when in trouble.
