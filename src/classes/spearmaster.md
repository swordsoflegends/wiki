# Spearmaster

Thanks to their ingenuity, manual dexterity, and knowledge of mechanics, Spearmasters have the power to summon special constructions which they and their allies can sell superfluous items to. This device can also repair damaged gear for a little gold while on adventures!

## General (Melee DPS)

Yuejiang, the movement’s founder, originally developed the Spearmaster’s special techniques. Spearmasters have an indomitable will, allowing them to keep a cool head in even the toughest of fights while making deadly use of their skills. They can use their spears to launch enemies into the air, incapacitating them while they land even more precision strikes.

## Phalanx (Tank)

With expert use of their armor, the Spearmaster becomes a living bulwark whose fighting spirit is utterly unswerving.

Mountains crumble faster than these armored heroes, who are capable of dashing to their targets in an instant or pulling them forwards to direct their attention away from allies. The Phalanx can position themselves in front of their team to reduce incoming damage by summoning a shield wall.
