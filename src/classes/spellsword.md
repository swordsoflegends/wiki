# Spellsword

Spellswords are well-versed in many ancient techniques, including the art of teleportation, which allows them to move a whole team to a previously marked location. The Spellsword tradition is based on the Nine Imperial Sword Techniques, which were honed and refined by the immortal Zhengyang.

## Sword Artist (Ranged DPS)

As ranged combatants, Sword Artists use their qi to make swords fly, attacking enemies safely from a distance. Staying out of danger is made easier by driving enemies back with spells, as well as their unique ability to teleport to magical swords strategically placed around the battlefield.

## Bladestorm (Melee DPS)

Bladestorms can use powerful melee attacks to punish their enemies by setting up swords in a pentagram-like shape, capable of stunning any hostile trespassers. These masters of the ancient blade can move across the battlefields of Swords of Legends Online with lightning speed, leaving behind mere echoes of their previous location while striking their enemies with deadly blows.
