# Spellsword

Spellswords are well-versed in many ancient techniques, including the art of teleportation, which allows them to move a whole team to a previously marked location. The Spellsword tradition is based on the Nine Imperial Sword Techniques, which were honed and refined by the immortal Zhengyang.
