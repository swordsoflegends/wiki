# Bard

Bards play an important role in the combat of Swords of Legends Online by providing their allies with supporting damage or protection. They can also summon a special furnace that both they and their allies can use to apply buffs before venturing into dangerous situations.

## Dissonance (Ranged DPS)

The spiritual energies of the five elements dance to the tune of the Bard’s music. Using their virtuosic skills, Bards can harness these elements, weaving specific effects into their magical attacks. This symphony of tone and element is what makes the Bard’s Soulforce so notoriously powerful.

## Harmony (Support)

Bards can also manipulate the spiritual energy of the five elements and channel their Soulforce to heal the wounded or dispel evil spirits. Their magic can be used to protect their allies from harm by surrounding them in protective shields that mitigate damage or encasing them in ice to avoid fatal blows.
