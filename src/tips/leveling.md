# Leveling

## Stuck on Level 33

If you are at level 33 and have no more quests to get to level 34, it helps to do the Frostbitten Path dungeon a few times with the Companion members. Each time you do it, you get 10k XP and items you can sell.

## Use Cultivation

Always try to look up the Cultivation, it always says where you can currently make XP. Cultivation can be found at the top right of the round icon.
