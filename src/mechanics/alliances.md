# Alliances

In Swords of Legends Online, the traditional guild is called an Alliance. Alliances are not account-wide, so you can join 6 different guilds on 6 different characters. Being in an Alliance gives you incentives such as Alliance quests, guild buffs (i.e. increased XP from mobs) and talents (i.e. reduced repair cost), and access to Alliance currency where you turn in for high quality gear from Alliance merchants.

Alliances start out with a low member cap (50) in the beginning. As you level your Alliance up, you will increase your member cap. Scroll down to Guilds under Other Info for more details.
