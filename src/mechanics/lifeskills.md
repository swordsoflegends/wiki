## Basics

There are three life skills in this game: fishing, cooking and crafting. Each life skill has its own level. However, there are no level limitations for what you can fish/cook/craft. Though, at lower levels, the materials you gain from the open world (fish/ingredients/gathering) will be untradable. Higher skill levels will also grant you skill points that you can freely assign for various buffs. (Credit: Tracy)

## Fishing

- Fish are important ingredients for cooking food. You can fish in any area with water. But useful fish products only come from certain spots in the water area. There are two types of fish spots: blue and gold. Blue spots are personal spots while gold spots are public-shared. Blue spots refresh biweekly-weekly while gold spots refresh slightly faster. Different maps have different fish products. Each fish spot has a fixed type of fish production. You can preview the product from a spot by hovering your mouse on it. You can get extra products other than fish if you are lucky. There are super rare gears with special stat combos that only come from fishing. There are also housing items as extra products.

- There is a set of gears specifically for fishing. This gear set grants you higher abilities (more extra products, faster casting time, etc.) They can be crafted from recipes bought with fishing coins. You earn fishing coins if you fish with a special bait. There are also daily fishing tasks and weekly fishing events to earn more fishing coins.

## Cooking

- Cooking is an important life skill for better battle performance. It uses ingredients you get from fishing, gathering and hunting. There are different recipes for PVP and PVE which the foods grant you different stat boosts. Most recipes can be bought from general stores or reputation stores, but some recipes may only be looted from raids and dungeons. Cooking is 100% success and you may gain double products sometimes. It is also possible to get a higher quality food (higher stats) given luck. A higher skill level in cooking can grant you higher probability in these events. Skill leveling exp is usually from learning new recipes and cooking more food.

## Gathering

- Like fishing, there are different products on different maps. Products are separated into blue (personal) and gold (shared). The amount of blue products refreshed depends on your account activity last week. Products from gathering have three levels: crude, refined, and essence. You can turn 2 crude products into 1 refined, and turn 3 refined into 1 essence with some auxiliary materials. There is also a set of gears for gathering. The recipes for these gears can be obtained with luck from gathering activities. This gear set grants you buffs for higher efficiency gathering.

## Hunting

- You can get chests from hunting in different maps. Each map has its own chest containing certain products only. There are material chest and ingredient chest. Ingredient chests yield what you need for cooking. Material chests yield a complement list of materials that you cannot get from gathering and also auxiliary materials for extracting higher quality.

## Crafting

- You can craft all kinds of things including gears, enchant, potion, etc. These usually need the products you get from gathering, hunting, and rare materials looted from dungeons and raids. Most things crafted are tradable but there are exceptions.
